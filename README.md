# **SOLID Principles – Java Examples**

This repository contains clear, clean, and practical examples of the SOLID principles implemented in Java.
The goal is to demonstrate how to write sustainable, readable, and extensible code by applying the SOLID design philosophy in real-world scenarios.



## **Contents**

S – Single Responsibility Principle

O – Open/Closed Principle

L – Liskov Substitution Principle

I – Interface Segregation Principle

D – Dependency Inversion Principle

Each folder includes a description of the principle and Java-based example usage.


S (Single Responsibility Principle - SRP): A class should have only one responsibility, meaning it should only have one reason to change.

O (Open/Closed Principle - OCP): Software components should be open for extension but closed for modification, meaning new functionality can be added without changing existing code.

L (Liskov Substitution Principle - LSP): Objects of a subclass should be able to replace objects of the superclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

I (Interface Segregation Principle - ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use, meaning large, complex interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.

D (Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.




## **What is SOLID?**

SOLID is a set of five core software design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin.
These principles help developers create:

Easily testable code

Highly adaptable systems

Modular and flexible architectures

Reduced coupling between components

Improved readability and maintainability

## **Technologies Used**

Java 17+

Clean code standards

Object-oriented programming principles

Realistic scenarios demonstrating each principle






## **Learning Purpose**

This repository is designed as a practical resource for junior to mid-level backend developers who want to understand and apply SOLID principles effectively.
It provides a foundation for using these principles in Spring Boot applications, microservices, and enterprise-level software architectures.
